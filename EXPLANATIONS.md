# Explanations

## Overview

We use the definition of an explanation that is context driven. An explanation
is a representation of a model in a language, for a purpose, to an audience. It
is sound if the representation is accurate to the model. And it is a good
explanation if the audience can understand the language and the purpose is
achieved.

## The structure of an explanation

We take the idea of dis/provable hypotheses as being the foundation of a
scientific explanation of the world as the basis for our explanations. A 
well-formed hypothesis is verifiable - there is a way to demonstrate that 
it is correct through either empirical or analytical methods.
