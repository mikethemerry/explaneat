# Plotting Fixes for Genome Explorer

## Problem Identified

The `explorer.plot_ancestry_fitness()` and `plot_training_metrics()` methods were not properly showing changes over generations. The issues were:

1. **Training Metrics Confusion**: The `plot_training_metrics()` method was correctly showing epochs (training iterations within a single genome), but users expected to see generation-based evolution.

2. **Ancestry Fitness Issues**: The `plot_ancestry_fitness()` method had issues with data processing and wasn't clearly showing the evolutionary progression across generations.

3. **Missing Population-Level View**: There was no method to show the full evolutionary progression across all generations in an experiment.

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. Enhanced Training Metrics Plotting
- **Fixed**: Clarified that `plot_training_metrics()` shows epochs within a single genome
- **Added**: Better titles and labels to distinguish epochs vs generations
- **Improved**: Added generation information to the plot title

### 2. Improved Ancestry Fitness Plotting
- **Fixed**: Added duplicate removal and proper sorting by generation
- **Enhanced**: Added generation range information display
- **Improved**: Added summary statistics showing fitness improvement and network growth
- **Added**: Better error handling for insufficient data

### 3. New Population-Level Evolution Plotting
- **Added**: `plot_evolution_progression()` method that shows:
  - Population fitness evolution (best, mean, std dev)
  - Population size changes over generations
  - Cumulative fitness improvement
  - Generation-to-generation improvements
- **Features**: Comprehensive 4-panel visualization with detailed statistics

## Usage Examples

```python
from explaneat.analysis.genome_explorer import GenomeExplorer

# Load a genome
explorer = GenomeExplorer.load_best_genome()

# 1. Show training progress within a single genome (epochs)
explorer.plot_training_metrics()

# 2. Show evolution across generations for this lineage
explorer.plot_ancestry_fitness()

# 3. Show full population evolution across all generations
explorer.plot_evolution_progression()
```

## Key Differences

| Method | Shows | Time Scale | Purpose |
|--------|-------|------------|---------|
| `plot_training_metrics()` | Epochs within genome | Training iterations | How a single genome improved during training |
| `plot_ancestry_fitness()` | Generations in lineage | Evolutionary generations | How a specific lineage evolved |
| `plot_evolution_progression()` | Population evolution | All generations | How the entire population evolved |

## Files Modified

1. **`explaneat/analysis/genome_explorer.py`**:
   - Enhanced `plot_training_metrics()` with better labeling
   - Improved `plot_ancestry_fitness()` with data processing fixes
   - Added `plot_evolution_progression()` for population-level analysis

2. **`run_working_backache.py`**:
   - Updated visualization testing to demonstrate all three methods

3. **`test_plotting_fixes.py`** (new):
   - Test script demonstrating the different plotting methods

## Testing

Run the test script to see all three plotting methods in action:

```bash
python test_plotting_fixes.py
```

This will demonstrate:
- Training metrics (epochs within genome)
- Ancestry fitness (generations in lineage)  
- Evolution progression (population-level evolution)
- Network structure visualization

## Summary

The fixes now provide three distinct views of the evolutionary process:
1. **Micro-level**: Training progress within individual genomes (epochs)
2. **Lineage-level**: Evolution of specific genetic lineages (generations)
3. **Population-level**: Full evolutionary progression across all generations

This gives users a comprehensive understanding of both the training dynamics and evolutionary progression in their NEAT experiments.
