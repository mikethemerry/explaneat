ExplaNEAT is a suite of tools used to create explanations of the inner workings 
of neural networks that have been trained using the PropNEAT algorithm.

## Getting Started

## Behind ExplaNEAT

The PropNEAT algorithm uses graph analysis methods to create a way of training
models trained with NEAT using back propagation in a way that is efficient on GPUs.
