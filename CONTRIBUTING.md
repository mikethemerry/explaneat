## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher
- Git
- Basic familiarity with NEAT, PyTorch, and evolutionary algorithms
- Understanding of neural networks and machine learning concepts

### Areas for Contribution

We welcome contributions in several areas:

- **Core Algorithm Improvements**: Enhancements to the NEAT-backpropagation integration
- **New Features**: Additional analysis tools, fitness functions, or visualization options
- **Performance Optimizations**: Speed improvements, memory optimizations, GPU acceleration
- **Documentation**: API documentation, tutorials, examples, and guides
- **Testing**: Unit tests, integration tests, and benchmarking
- **Bug Fixes**: Identifying and fixing issues in the codebase
- **Examples**: New usage examples and application demonstrations

## Development Setup

### 1. Fork and Clone

```bash
# Fork the repository on GitHub, then clone your fork
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/explaneat.git
cd explaneat

# Add the upstream repository
git remote add upstream https://github.com/mikethemerry/explaneat.git
```

### 2. Set Up Development Environment

```bash
# Create a virtual environment
python -m venv explaneat-dev
source explaneat-dev/bin/activate  # On Windows: explaneat-dev\Scripts\activate

# Install dependencies including development tools
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install -e .

# Install development dependencies
pip install pytest black flake8 mypy sphinx
```

### 3. Verify Setup

```bash
# Run basic import test
python -c "from explaneat.core.explaneat import ExplaNEAT; print('Setup successful!')"

# Run existing tests (if available)
python -m pytest tests/
```

## Making Contributions

### 1. Create a Branch

Always create a new branch for your work:

```bash
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
# or
git checkout -b fix/issue-description
```

### 2. Branch Naming Conventions

- `feature/description` - New features
- `fix/description` - Bug fixes
- `docs/description` - Documentation improvements
- `test/description` - Test additions
- `refactor/description` - Code refactoring

### 3. Make Your Changes

Follow these guidelines when making changes:

- **Keep changes focused**: One feature or fix per branch
- **Write clear commit messages**: Describe what and why, not just how
- **Update documentation**: Update docstrings and documentation files as needed
- **Add tests**: Include tests for new functionality
- **Follow code style**: Use the project's coding conventions

## Code Style Guidelines

### Python Code Style

We follow PEP 8 with some specific preferences:

```python
# Use descriptive variable names
population_size = 50  # Good
pop_sz = 50          # Avoid

# Function and method docstrings
def calculate_density(self):
    """
    Calculate parameter density as ratio of actual to dense parameters.
    
    Returns:
        float: Parameter density between 0.0 and 1.0
    """
    pass

# Class docstrings
class ExplaNEAT:
    """
    Main class for neural network analysis and explanation.
    
    This class provides tools for analyzing evolved neural networks,
    including depth calculation, density measurement, and skippiness analysis.
    
    Args:
        genome: NEAT genome object
        config: NEAT configuration object
        neat_class: Neural network implementation class
    """
    pass
```

### Code Formatting

We use Black for code formatting:

```bash
# Format your code before committing
black explaneat/ tests/ examples/

# Check with flake8
flake8 explaneat/ tests/ examples/
```

### Type Hints

Use type hints where possible:

```python
from typing import Dict, List, Optional, Tuple
import numpy as np
import torch

def analyze_network(genome: neat.DefaultGenome, 
                   config: neat.Config) -> Dict[str, float]:
    """Analyze network properties."""
    pass
```

## Testing

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
python -m pytest tests/

# Run with coverage
python -m pytest tests/ --cov=explaneat

# Run specific test file
python -m pytest tests/test_core.py
```

### Writing Tests

Create tests for new functionality:

```python
import pytest
import numpy as np
from explaneat.core.explaneat import ExplaNEAT

class TestExplaNEAT:
    def test_depth_calculation(self):
        """Test network depth calculation."""
        # Setup test data
        # Create assertions
        assert explainer.depth() > 0
    
    def test_density_calculation(self):
        """Test parameter density calculation."""
        # Test implementation
        assert 0.0 <= explainer.density() <= 1.0
```

## Documentation

### Docstring Style

Use NumPy/SciPy docstring format:

```python
def retrain(self, X_train: np.ndarray, y_train: np.ndarray, 
           n_epochs: int = 100, choose_best: bool = True) -> None:
    """
    Retrain the network using backpropagation.
    
    Parameters
    ----------
    X_train : np.ndarray
        Training features with shape (n_samples, n_features)
    y_train : np.ndarray  
        Training targets with shape (n_samples, n_outputs)
    n_epochs : int, default=100
        Number of training epochs
    choose_best : bool, default=True
        Whether to keep the best model based on validation loss
    
    Examples
    --------
    >>> explainer.net.retrain(X_train, y_train, n_epochs=50)
    """
    pass
```
